### **Sexual Assault on College Campuses**
#### <img src="https://github.com/elizabethstrattner/elizabethstrattner.github.io/blob/main/J025%20Infographic%20Assignment-2.png?raw=true" width="390" height="500" /> 
##### Sexual assault is an incredibly prevalent problem on college campuses. This infographic, which displays data sourced from [Know Your IX](https://www.knowyourix.org/issues/statistics/), shows some of the most concerning information concerning sexual assault and college students. To find this data, all it took was a quick Google search of "sexual assault statistics" for tons of information, including the statistics on this website, to come up. This data shows the frighteningly high prevalence of sexual assault among women in college—19% of all women in college, to be specific—while also showing how infrequently rapists are jailed for their crimes. The infographic also displays a graphic showing that 90% of all sexual assaults are committed by individuals  the survivor knows. This information is incredibly important, as this knowledge could raise awareness among college students that sexual assault doesn't have to be perpetrated by a stranger in an alley—it could be, and according to the numbers likely would be, perpetrated someone you know quite well.

### **Le-Laf Timeline**
##### This was an in-class project where we learned how to create a timeline using TimelineJS. The topic of the timeline is the Le-Laf football rivalry, and the long history of games that led us to where the rivalry is today. Information from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rivalry_(Lafayette–Lehigh).

### **Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment by College, 2019**
##### This project was to practice using Chartbuilder to make bar/column charts. This data represents Lehigh's 2019 undergraduate population, sorted by the population's enrollment in each of Lehigh's colleges. The data is sourced from [Lehigh's Office of Instiutional Research](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf).

### **Lehigh Undergraduate Students by Residence, 2019**
##### This data, sourced from [Lehigh's Office of Institutional Research](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2019.pdf), shows the breakdown of the university's undergraduate students in 2019 by where they lived. Residence halls housed the most undergraduate students,followed by off-campus residences, then sorority houses, and ending with fraternity houses, which housed the lowest percentage of undergraduate students in 2019.

### **Percentage of Students in Lehigh's Undergraduate Colleges by Year**
##### This chart uses data from [Lehigh's Office of Insitutional Research](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/university-profile) to display the percentage of students enrolled in Lehigh's three undergraduate colleges, and the changes in those enrollment percentages over time. Between 2017 and 2021, enrollment in the College of Arts and Sciences increased while enrollment in both the College of Engineering and the College of Business decreased. This information might tell Lehigh that they need to market the engineering and business programs more, or that they need to alter those two programs to make them better for students.

### **Life Satisfaction and GDP per capita**
##### This data, taken from [World Bank](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction) shows the correlation between life satisfaction in cantril ladder and GDP per capita in 2019. Looking at the chart, the general trend seems to be that lower GDP per capita correlates with lower life satisfaction. This information is important because it shows that GDP can be used as a significant teller of life satisfaction when looking at various countries.

### **Distribution of Minority Populations in America by Race**
##### This chart displays the distribution of the United States' minority populations by race between 1980 and 2020. The Black and African American and American Indian and Alaska Native populations have remained relatively stable over time, while the other minority populations have skyrocketed. The group two or more races increased the most dramatically over time—one of the likely reasons for this being that "two or more races" wasn't an option on the US Census before 2000. It's interesting to see the changes in demographics in our country throughout the years, especially because most of the minority populations are increasing. This has serious implications for considering the way our country is run, and what systematic obstacles are in the way of these growing minority populations. Data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States).

### **Top 5 Happiest Cities in the World**
##### This map is a visualization of the top five happiest cities in the world, according to the [World Happiness Report's 2020 analysis](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/cities-and-happiness-a-global-ranking-and-analysis/). The rankings are based on self-reports by residents across the world, allowing them to express how high their own quality of life is. Scandinavia dominates the rankings, with Scandinavian cities securing six of the top ten spots on the list. These self-rankings can provide guidance to policymakers on how to enhance the well-being of their residents, and show them which countries to look to for direction.
